Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re trying to understand randomness. Probability distributions are like the blueprints or recipes that describe how randomness behaves in different situations. They are a fundamental concept in probability and statistics and are used everywhere from weather forecasting to financial modeling to understanding the spread of diseases.
What is a Probability Distribution? (The Core Idea)
At its heart, a probability distribution is a complete description of the probabilities of all possible outcomes for a random variable.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/about/</guid><description>From a young age, I was known as the go-to tech person in my village, solving computer-related issues and staying updated with every development in the computer and mobile phone industry. This passion naturally led me to pursue Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
My dream was to study at Bogazici University, the top institution in Turkey for this field. I achieved this goal, ranking 59th out of 2 million participants in the entrance exam, a testament to my dedication and hard work.</description></item><item><title>Neural Radiance Fields A Technical Deep Dive into 3D Scene Representation</title><link>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/neural-radiance-fields/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/neural-radiance-fields/</guid><description>Neural Radiance Fields: A Technical Deep Dive into 3D Scene Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis by leveraging neural networks to model complex scenes with unprecedented detail and flexibility. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the technical foundations, key components, and underlying rationale of NeRF.
NeRF represents a 3D scene as a continuous 5D function:

As a matter of fact, all the information is gathered from the paper itself otherwise it will be indicated.
First letâ€™s start with some definition of the problem. The task of Guided Super Resolution can be defined as a unifying framework for several computer vision tasks where the inputs are</description></item><item><title>Data Wrangling with PySpark</title><link>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/data-wrangling-with-pyspark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/data-wrangling-with-pyspark/</guid><description>It becomes very hard to work with pandas when the data is huge. Instead as a strong alternative PySpark comes along. In this tutorial I will introduce the PySpark and mirror our pandas abilities to PySpark. This post assumes the reader has familiarity with the pandas library.
Introduction to Spark The first question is what is Spark. Apache Spark is fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It distributes computations among the CPU cores to do parallel processing.</description></item><item><title>Recommendation Engines Overview</title><link>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/recommendation-engines-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/recommendation-engines-overview/</guid><description>In these days, for customers there are so many alternatives to use a mobile app for a specific task and most of them work well in terms of functionality. What differs in terms of the customer is the experience you gave them. The most powerful influence that you can give to the customer is making them feel special. To do this you must provide a personalized experience for each customer. Recommendation Engines are exactly developed on that purpose.</description></item><item><title>AWS Personalize Tutorial</title><link>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/aws-personalize-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetsat.github.io/homepage/aws-personalize-tutorial/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION AWS Personalize dashboard summarizes all the steps for deploying the personalize model.
